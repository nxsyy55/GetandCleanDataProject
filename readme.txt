You can check my comments in the .R file to see what I did on the data. But here is the summary.

1# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
The output is a 10299 by 563 data frame named data.all.

2# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
I first read the feature names from the features.txt and keep all the variables with the word 'mean' or 'std' in their names. 
Then I append two extra cols to the data frame, namely, Act(Activity) and Subject.
By now, I get a 10299 by 81 named data frame, data.trim.

# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
I named the variables in the Act col.

# Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
# for each activity and each subject. 
I first split the data.trim into 30 subgroups by the subject id. 
And then I use aggreate() function on each subgroup to get the mean.
Finally I combined the 30 data frames as one.

The result is a 180 by 81 data frame with col names as:
